# Risk-Game
This project is using the MVC architecture design. The structure separates into 3 main parts for the system, called Controller, Model, and View.

### 1. Controller: 
In this project, it has 4 controllers, GameController, MainController, MapEditorController, and TournamentController. <br/>

#### 1.1 MainController:
In the MainController, it is the menu model of the system when first launched, it gives players 2 options at the beginning, either play game or edit map.

#### 1.2 GameController:
In the GameController, there is one method, excute, to perform the whole phase of the gameplay, including startup phase, reinforcement phase, attack phase and fortification phase. 

#### 1.3 MapEditorController:
This controller will be called when the player choose to edit map. Any operation related to map editing, will be implemented in this controller.

#### 1.4 TournamentController:
This controller will be called when the player choose the tournament mode. In this mode, the player can choose 1 to 5 maps, how many games will play in each map, and 2 to 4 AI
players. <br/>
Once the player finished choosing those options, the mode will run the input and show the final result for each map and game to the user.

### 2. Model:
Model is the component where all the data related logic respond to, the model will manage all behavior and data during the whole process of the application.

#### 2.1 GamePlay:
In the GamePlay package, we created classes and their related attributes that will be </br>
needed during the game, which includes card, dices, phase and player

#### 2.2 Strategy:
Strategy is a sub-package of the GamePlay package. This package is dealing with strategy </br>
classes for players. It include 4 AI strategy classes such as Aggressive AI, Benevolent AI, </br>
Random AI, and Cheater AI. Human class in this package is dealing with the human playerâ€™s </br>
actions. The ConcreteStrategy class is for the basic functions that needed to be used for other </br>
classes in this package. The Strategy class is for the combine of four strategies for players </br>
and easy to let programmer to import the strategy classes.

#### 2.3 Map:
The Map package contains classes like Continent.class, Country.class, Map.class, MapEditor.class, and MapChecker.class. </br>
The first two classes deal with the basic data and logic for two main map properties in the game. </br>
The Map class is one of the most important class in the project, since no operation can run without map, it carries the most functions	</br>
among other classes, which includes functions for checking validation of maps, data change, saving, and loading maps, set country armies and so on. </br> 
The functions in MapEditor class can let users create, editing, and save map files. </br>
The MapChecker class is mainly for checking whether if a map passes all the tests, and to determine if it is playable or not.

#### 2.4 Utilities:
Utilities package includes useful classes that can be widely reused by other classes. </br>
Such as FileHandler class for reading and writing files. Rng class dealing with random index values. </br>
The StringAnalyzer class focus on the string function logic. 
		
### View:
Packages: Common, GamePlay, MapEditor <br/>
View mainly deals with functions that making the functions in other parts can be easily viewed by users. <br/>
The Common package helps to show the main menu to help users to choose whether they want to edit the map or play the game. <br/>
The gamePlay package helps users to choose map files and implementing the game state phases for users to know what is happening when playing the game. <br/>
The MapEditor class fulfill functions for showing the map properties to help users create and editing maps. <br/>
